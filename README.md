HTML, CSS: Code-refractor assignment.

This assignment focuses on cleaning up Horiseon's webpage by adjusting their current HTML semantics to more accurately reference the CSS coding. 
    - Changing <div> headers to [ex]<header class="header">
        - These html semantics allow for linked CSS files to group portions of header-assigned HTML code and apply the same translations/effects/outputs to the website. 

This assignment also required CSS file cleansing:
    - There we're multiple unnecessary repeat CSS header blocks that were functioning in the same way/style/inputs. 
        - By grouping HTML packets into less css header groups, we were able to reduce the amount of CSS code lines needed to produce the same output.
